    <h1>🌟 About Me — Shubham Singh</h1>
    <h3><p>
        Hello and welcome! I’m Shubham Singh, a passionate Senior Test Engineer with over 6.5 years of experience in the software industry, specializing in Quality Assurance, Test Automation, and Frontend Testing frameworks. My journey in technology has been a blend of curiosity, persistence, and an ever-growing desire to make software more reliable, scalable, and user-friendly.
    </p></h3>

    <h3><p>
        I began my professional journey at CSS Corp, where I was introduced to the fundamentals of quality assurance. This early phase shaped my mindset about how every line of code and every user interaction has a story behind it — a story that deserves to work seamlessly. I learned the importance of attention to detail, test coverage, and most importantly, the mindset of thinking like an end user.
    </p></h3>

    <h3><p>
        Later, during my tenure at Cognizant, I gained exposure to large-scale enterprise systems and global clients. Here, I worked on projects that demanded precision, scalability, and coordination across multi-functional teams. I deepened my expertise in Selenium, Protractor, and TypeScript, automating workflows that reduced manual effort and improved efficiency. It was also here that I started exploring framework design and optimization, which became a major turning point in my career.
    </p></h3>

    <h3><p>
        Currently, I’m working as a Senior Test Engineer at Alten India Pvt Ltd, where I’ve had the privilege to collaborate with international clients such as Amadeus and Newegg. My role involves end-to-end automation strategy — from framework development to CI/CD integration — using tools and technologies like Playwright, Selenium, Rest Assured, Java, and TypeScript. I enjoy designing automation solutions that not only test effectively but also provide clarity and maintainability for future teams.

    <h2>💼 My Professional Journey</h2>
    <h3><p>
        Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work across diverse domains — e-commerce, travel, and logistics — each bringing new challenges and learning curves.
    </p></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>
            At Newegg, I focused on both manual and automation testing, ensuring end-to-end user flows across complex e-commerce systems.
        </h3></li>
        <li><h3>
            At UPS, I contributed to automation using Protractor and TypeScript, optimizing regression cycles and maintaining test reliability for logistics modules.
        </h3></li>
        <li><h3>
            At Amadeus, one of the world’s leading travel technology companies, I’ve worked extensively with Playwright and Java, integrating test suites with Octane and Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines.
        </h3></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Each project helped me strengthen different facets of testing — from UI validations and API automation to data-driven testing and environment-specific executions.
    </h3>
    <br /><hr />

    <h2>🧠 My Technical Expertise</h2>
    <h3>
        I believe that automation is not just about writing scripts — it’s about crafting intelligent solutions that evolve with the product. My technical toolkit includes:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Automation Frameworks: Playwright, Selenium, Rest Assured</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Languages: Java, TypeScript, JavaScript</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Test Frameworks: Cucumber, TestNG, JUnit</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Design Patterns: Page Object Model (POM), Data-Driven Testing, BDD</h3></li>
        <li><h3>CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Octane Integration</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Reporting: Allure, Extent, Cucumber HTML Reports</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Version Control: Git, Bitbucket</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Other Tools: Postman, JIRA, Azure DevOps</h3></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        I also focus heavily on writing clean, modular, and maintainable test code, following best practices such as separating configuration, reusable utilities, and environment handling.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>🎯 My Vision</h2>
    <p><h3>
        As I continue growing in this field, my goal is to transition into the role of a QA Architect or Frontend Developer — someone who not only ensures quality through automation but also contributes to building smarter, more testable front-end applications.
    </h3></p>
    <h3><p>
        I believe that the future of QA lies in the synergy between development and testing, where testers think like developers, and developers code with testability in mind. I’m deeply passionate about bridging that gap through continuous learning, mentoring, and framework innovation.
    </p></h3>
    <h2>💪 My Core Strengths</h2>
    <h3><p>

    <h2>💡 My Personal Philosophy</h2>
    <h3><p>
        Quality assurance, to me, is more than a job — it’s a mindset. It’s about predicting what could go wrong before it does. It’s about empathy for users and pride in reliability. I believe in testing with intent — understanding not only how a feature works but why it exists.
    </p></h3>
    <p><h3>    
        I’m also a firm believer in the shift-left approach — embedding QA early in the development lifecycle — and leveraging automation to accelerate quality feedback.
    </p></h3>
    <br />

    <h2>💬 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <h3><p>
        From my early manual testing days to leading complex automation suites, this journey has taught me one core lesson — testing is not about finding bugs, it’s about building confidence. Every test you automate, every assertion you write, contributes to a user’s seamless experience somewhere in the world.
    </p></h3>
    <h3><p>
        And that’s what keeps me motivated every single day — the idea that behind every great product, there’s an invisible layer of quality ensuring everything just works.
    </p></h3>
